## Postgraduate Thesis

{{< accordion "Serum and Salivary Uric Acid Estimation and Its Correlation in Patients with Preeclampsia" >}}

**Institution:** AIIMS Raipur, Chhattisgarh  
**Year:** 2022

**Summary:** This original research work investigated the relationship between serum and salivary uric acid levels in pregnant women with preeclampsia. The study aimed to develop a non-invasive method for monitoring preeclampsia using salivary uric acid as a biomarker. The findings contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and may lead to better screening methods.

**Key Findings:**

- Correlation between serum and salivary uric acid levels in preeclamptic patients
- Potential use of salivary uric acid as a non-invasive screening tool
- Clinical implications for preeclampsia management

This research was presented at the **Raipur Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (ROGS)** conference.
