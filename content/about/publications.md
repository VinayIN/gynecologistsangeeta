### Postgraduate Thesis

#### Serum and Salivary Uric Acid Estimation and Its Correlation in Patients with Preeclampsia
**Institution:** AIIMS Raipur, Chhattisgarh

**Year:** 2022

**Guide:** [Faculty name]

**Summary:** This original research work investigated the relationship between serum and salivary uric acid levels in pregnant women with preeclampsia. The study aimed to develop a non-invasive method for monitoring preeclampsia using salivary uric acid as a biomarker. The findings contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and may lead to better screening methods.

**Key Findings:**
- Correlation between serum and salivary uric acid levels in preeclamptic patients
- Potential use of salivary uric acid as a non-invasive screening tool
- Clinical implications for preeclampsia management

This research was presented at the **Raipur Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (ROGS)** conference.

### Ongoing Research Projects

#### 1. Ophthalmic Artery Doppler in Prediction of Preeclampsia in First Trimester
**Objective:** To evaluate the role of ophthalmic artery Doppler as an early predictor of preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy.

**Significance:** Early prediction of preeclampsia can help in timely intervention and improved maternal outcomes.

#### 2. Fetomaternal Outcome in Pregnancies with Leptospirosis
**Objective:** To study the impact of leptospirosis infection on pregnancy outcomes and maternal-fetal health.

**Significance:** Leptospirosis is an important tropical infection that can affect pregnancy. Understanding its impact can guide management protocols.

#### 3. Prevalence of Peripartum Cardiomyopathy
**Objective:** To determine the prevalence and risk factors of peripartum cardiomyopathy in the local population.

**Significance:** Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare but serious condition that can be life-threatening. Identifying prevalence helps in better preparedness.

#### 4. Case Series of Disorders of Sexual Differentiation
**Objective:** To document and analyze cases of disorders of sexual development (DSD) presenting in gynecological practice.

**Significance:** Understanding these rare conditions helps in appropriate management and counseling of affected individuals and families.
